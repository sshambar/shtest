=== Example Test Scripts ===

Several scripts to demonstrate simple test suites created with
shtest_setup.

my_funcs - shell functions being testing

good.sh - tests that all succeed

fails:sh - tests that have various kinds of failures

Both good.sh and fails.sh have options to change strict mode and logging:
  <options> include:
    help - show help
    verbose - always show test descriptions
    quiet - show summary only
    strict - enable -eEu bash option
    trace - enable -eEu bash option with traceback
    +<id/pattern> - show test <id/pattern(*|?)> (may be repeated)

crash.sh - failure cases that lead to the script exiting, options are:
  'badcall' - shows failure when shtest function is called incorrectly
  'unbound' - demonstrates unbound variable traceback in strict mode
  'whitelist' - shows strict mode failure, and whitelisting the caller
     to allow testing the failure.
  'dup' - shows failure when test id's are re-used
